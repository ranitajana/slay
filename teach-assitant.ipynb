      "The first step in preparing for a speech is to create an outline that is easy to remember. This involves breaking down your speech into 3 to 5 main points that flow logically from one to another. By chunking the information in this way, you can avoid the need for rote memorization and instead focus on the natural progression of your ideas. This method allows you to have a clear structure for your speech without the burden of memorizing every word.\n",

      "Once you have your outline, the next step is to flesh out each point with relevant details, stories, and supporting information. Writing everything down helps you organize your thoughts and ensures you have a comprehensive speech to work from. This process also allows you to refine your content by identifying and eliminating unnecessary details that do not contribute to your main points.\n",

      "Subvocalize your speech without using visual cues (00:04:02.400 - 00:05:56.475):\n",
      "Subvocalization involves mentally rehearsing your speech by quietly verbalizing the main points without relying on visual aids. This practice helps you internalize the structure and flow of your speech while avoiding the pitfalls of strict memorization. By subvocalizing, you can ensure that you understand the key points and can deliver them naturally without being tied to a script or visual prompts.\n",

      "Memorize the first and last sentences word for word (00:05:56.475 - 00:07:09.151):\n",
      "To make a strong impression on your audience, it is essential to memorize the opening and closing lines of your speech. The first sentence serves as a hook to capture attention, while the last sentence provides a sense of closure and finality. By committing these key sentences to memory, you can start and end your speech confidently and leave a lasting impact on your listeners.\n"
